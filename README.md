# This is an assignment for Web Programming class

Project developed by me, Vinicius Wagner and LÃ­gia Nogueira, students of Software Engineering. We have been developing the entire project for two months during the Web Programming class, taught by Ricardo Kondo, on FACOM-UFMS. With the Ricardos's support, it consists in a quiz game application with users.
This is a quiz where you click on Play button, choose a music genrer and after that is showed to you a song's verse and two options with a song name and singer, you need pick up the correct.

## How did we build it?

We had HTML, CSS, JS and React classes, from this we studied more about React components, props and routes to construct all the project using React components. But inicially, we just had static pages with HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, in the third week we started to reuse our code adaptading it for components, after this we read about Firebase Datastore to be our DB and deploy the Questions, SignUp and SignIn features.

We are working in some features, like a scoreboarding in Ranking tab that is static now, but we hope that soon we will be able to develop it. The project may have some bugs or validation's problems.
